    "#### 7.3 Open Models from the Hugging Face Model Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the following task, we are going to work with Llama, a Large Language Model provided by Meta. We want to use it to classify the same 30 texts as you and LEIA did already to compare sentiment classification performance.\n",
    "* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a platform where different machine learning models are distributed. We are going to use the Llama Model via this page.\n",
    "* Since language models can get quite big, it makes sense to use these with a GPU for faster loading and inference. Therefore, we need a provider of GPU access. Options are either [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).\n",
    "* This guide is going to outline the use via Kaggle, but you are free to use other services for GPU access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create an account and sign into [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login)\n",
    "2) Create an account and sign into [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)\n",
    "    * Here, you need to generate an [API Key on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) in order to be able to access the models (see screenshot below)\n",
    "    * Save the access token in a .txt file \n",
    "\n",
    "3) We are going to use the Llama Model in Version 3.1 with 8 billion parameters. To do so, you need to request the access from Meta via the [models hugging face page](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). On the linked page, you should find a box telling you that you need to request model access. To be granted access should happen within a couple of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) To use the model, we now need to move to Kaggle. After you logged in, check out the sidebar on the left hand, where you can find a menu option `Code`. Select it and click on `+ New Notebook`. After the notebook got opened, navigate to the top left, select `File` and `Import Notebook`. Upload this notebook.\n",
    " * On Kaggle, you have 30h of GPU use per \n",
    " * To start GPU usage, navigate to the right. In the `Session options` under `Accelerator` you can use select a GPU to use. To save compute time, make sure to turn this usage off, after you are done (but be aware that turning on and off stops and restarts your session (kernel restart)).\n",
    " * To later download your notebook, again use `File` and `Download Notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Next, we need to install the hugging face package for python to be able to load the model. To get the access, we have to authenticate via the API key, we generated on Hugging Face.\n",
    "* Code to install the packages is provided below.\n",
