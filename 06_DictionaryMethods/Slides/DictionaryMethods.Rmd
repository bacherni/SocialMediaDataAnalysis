# Dictionary methods: the General Inquirer

<div style="float:right">
<img src="GI.jpg" alt="General Inquirer" width="320px"/>  
</div>

The pioneer work of [Philip Stone in 1966](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/general-inquirer
) proposed to process text with a computer to detect the use of words of various categories. This set the basis for **dictionary methods** in text analysis, which are based on counting the number of appearances of the words of a list in a text. 

The lists of [positive words](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/Positiv.html) and of [negative words](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/Negativ.html) of this version, which served as input for later methods like [SentiStrength](http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/) (more on this later).

The [SentimentAnalysis R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SentimentAnalysis/index.html) contains the General Inquirer (GI) dictionary and methods to match words in text.

# The assumption: bag of words

.pull-left[1. Tokenize text to identify words and expressions, for example identifing whitespace and punctuation
2. Count the number of tokens of each kind in each text (term frequency)

- Result: each document is represented by a vector of word counts
- Ignores word order or relationship between words]

# Bag of words example

| Text      | he | sat | on | the | bank | bear | is | brown | did  | not|  survive |  crisis | didn't |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| He sat on the bank      | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  |  0 |  0 | 0 |0 | 
| The bear is brown   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  | 0|  0 | 0 | 0 | 
| The bank did not survive the crisis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1  | 1|  1 | 1 | 0 | 
| He didn't sat on the bear | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

## Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)

.center[![:scale 82%](LIWCexample.png)]  
LIWC (pronounced "Luke") was developed as a click-and-run software by [James Pennebaker in 2001](https://liwc.wpengine.com/), including word lists for emotions and ther classes.

---

# Examples of word classes in LIWC

- $funct_1$: **Function words**, words that do not carry strong meaning (structure)
  - $i_4$: **First-person references**, especially pronouns
  

- $affect_{125}$: **Affective words**, words signalling emotional experiences
  - $negemo_{127}$: **Negative emotion words**
    - $anx_{128}$: **Anxiety words**, words signalling fear, stress and anxiety


- $social_{121}$: **Social process words**, words about others, communities, and social activities


- $cogmech_{131}$: **Cognitive mechanisms**
  - $insight_{132}$: thinking and information processing
  - $incl_{138}$: inclusion terms, synthesis
  - $discrep_{134}$: discrepancy, identification of opposites

# What are emotions?

> Emotions as **core affect**: Short-lived psychological states that consume the individual's energy and strongly influence cognition and behavior, for example expression.

Emotional or affective behavior of an individual takes place at various timescales:

![](emotionscale.png)
- Reflex reactions: fast physiological responses  
- Core affect: relax quickly and are triggered by a stimulus
- Mood: slow-changing and constant emotional state 
- Personality traits are lifelong behavior patterns, some about emotions

---

# Computational Affective Science

> **Affective Science** is the (interdisciplinary) scientific study of emotions. 

> **Computational Affective Science** applies methods from Computer Science and Data Science to Affective Science. Some examples are:

- **Affective Computing:** Development of systems that detect, process, and elicit emotion  
- **Cyberpsychology of Affect:** Understanding the interplay between emotions and ICT  
- **Emotion Recognition:** Identification of human emotion using any kind of modality: text, voice, facial expression, physiological signals (skin conductance, muscle activity, EEG, fMRI), etc  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detection of subjective states from (textual) data, including emotion

---

# Measuring emotions

Emotions can be measured through various signals and observable behaviors:

![](measurement.png)

In the following, we are going to cover four models of how to capture emotions in quantitative research. Some approaches are better for some modes or signals (e.g. text, facial expression) than others.

# Ekman's basic emotions model

.center[![:scale 48%](ekman.png)]
Developed by **Paul Ekman** to classify facial expression of emotions.

# Plutchik's wheel of emotions
.center[![:scale 47%](Wheel.png)]

---

# The circumplex model of affect

.center[![:scale 47%](circumplex.png)]

---

# Dimensions in the circumplex model


> **Valence:** the degree of pleasure experienced in an emotion  
  
- Explains the most variance from positive/pleasant to negative/unpleasant
- It can be measured physiologically with smiling and frowning muscle activity
- It is the most common dimension of emotions included in text analysis  

> **Arousal:** the level of activity associated with an emotion  

- Explains less variance than valence but it is informative to differentiate emotions  
- It can be measured with skin conductance and heart rate sensors  
- Not so common in text analysis but can be estimated from voice tone

#  What is Sentiment Analysis?

> **Sentiment Analysis:** Computerized quantification of subjective states from text

.center[![](SentimentSchema.png)]

- Examples of subjective states: Emotions, feelings, attitudes, opinions...  
- Often vaguely defined and roughly equivalent to the dimension of valence in the circumplex model
- Sentiment quantification can have various formats: polarity, scores, labels...

# The Sentiment Analysis Boom

```{r echo=F, fig.width=14, fig.height=7, cache=T, fig.align='center'}
library(gtrendsR)
library(ggplot2)
trend <- gtrends("sentiment analysis", time="all")
ggplot(trend$interest_over_time, aes(x=date, y=hits)) + geom_line() + ylab("Google search volume") + xlab("Date") + theme_bw() + theme(text = element_text(size=30)) 
```

---

# Supervised vs Unsupervised Methods

- **Unsupervised sentiment analysis:**  
  - Uses expert knowledge (e.g. from psychologists) to quantify emotions  
  - Expert knowledge is encoded as a set of rules or a lexicon (dictionary) of words. Also known as "dictionary methods"  
  - Pros: Simple implementation, large coverage and recall  
  - Cons: Hard to customize for a particular context, low precision, expert bias

- **Supervised sentiment analysis (next week):**  
  - Uses a set of annotated texts to fit a model  
  - Annotations can come from readers or the authors of texts  
  - Pros: Automatic calibration, high precision  
  - Cons: Lower recall and coverage, need very large training datasets

## Counting positive and negative words

.center[![:scale 100%](MPQAex.png)]

- Methods similar to LIWC that count the number of positive and negative words
- Example: [Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) subjectivity lexicon](https://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/)
- [Bing Liu opinion lexicon for product reviews](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html)

# VADER 
<div style="float:right">
<img src="https://t-redactyl.io/figure/Vader_1.jpg" alt="VADER" width="395px"/>  
</div>

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a tool very similar to SentiStrength in the steps it follows:

1. Text preprocessing  
2. Word matching from a lexicon of positive/negative scored words  
3. Application of modifiers to the scores based on language rules
 
VADER's name suggests it is the "dark version" of LIWC ("Luke"). As the authors of VADER say
